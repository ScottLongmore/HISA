                   - Logging update requested by NDE, WARNING issued when pool_query.py finds no matching records,d
                     sub-programs that exit normally but do not produce output produce WARNING. 
                   - QC.TXT link issues for multiple storms fixed
                   - oparet coefficients updated, minor updates
                   - JPSS satellite variables (for future) commented out
2015/02/02  v1.5.2 - GFS file naming update 
2014/12/10  v1.5.1 - oparet fix for SH storms
                     ShortTermTrack fix for invest storms (missing positions)
                     netCDF global attribute fixes/updates 
2014/11/09  v1.5.0 - Added ATMS QC > 1 for +20% of retrievals, exits algorithm 
                   - Fix for M12 of ShortTermTrack to current synoptic time
                   - ATMS time windows adjusted, gettimes.sh replaced with datetimes.py
		   - XYA/RZA netCDF CF compliance fixes, standard names, valid range, units
		   - JTWC ATCF/FIX filename convention added to products
                   - npp_tc.py scheduler added, eventually will replace master script NPP_TC.sh
2014/07/30  v1.4.2 - Problems with new graphics code on newer ATMS MIRS data 
                     reverted to previous version of plotting code
2014/07/20  v1.4.1 - Added non-zero exit code status in ShortTermTrack for corrupt ATCF files 
                     Updated plotting code, graphics fill more of the frame
2014/07/03  v1.4.0 - Algorithm replaced MIRS ATMS cloud liquid water (clw) with liquid water path (lwp) 
                     to incorporate precipitating (eyewall/rainband) retrievals and added bias correction.
                   - Some sub-program (ShortTermTrack, Oparet) log designators changed from WARNING to INFO 
                     for non-critical exceptions (00 or -12 ATCF fix missing, swath too far from storm, etc)

2014/02/08  v1.3.2 - netCDF bug fixes, minor updates 
                   - ERROR to WARNING messages for sub-programs inside storm loop, so if one TC fails,
                     remaining TC's are processed
